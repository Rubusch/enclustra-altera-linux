Altera SOCFPGA Reset Manager

Required properties:
- compatible : "altr,rst-mgr", "syscon";
                Note that syscon is invoked for this device to support the FPGA
		bridge driver and possibly other devices in the future.  See
		also Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/syscon.txt
- reg : Should contain 1 register ranges(address and length)
- altr,modrst-offset : Should contain the offset of the first modrst register.
- #reset-cells: 1

Example:
	 rstmgr@ffd05000 {
		#reset-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "altr,rst-mgr", "syscon";
		reg = <0xffd05000 0x1000>;
		altr,modrst-offset = <0x10>;
	};
